# Word Ladder


### Introduction
A ***word ladder*** is a connection from one word to another formed by changing one letter at a time with the constraint that at each step the sequence of letters still forms a **valid** word.
>For example, here is a word ladder connecting "code" to "data"   
>&emsp;&emsp;code -> core -> care -> dare -> date -> data   
That word ladder, however, is not the shortest possible one. Although the words may be a little less familiar, the following ladder is one step shorter:   
&emsp;&emsp;code -> cade -> cate -> date -> data
### Implementation
**My job in this problem is to write a program that finds a minimal word ladder between two words.** My code will make use of several of Java standard library, along with breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest such sequence.
### Guideline 
Anyway, if you do not care about what I am talking about above, it does **not** matter. What I am talking about below is what really affects you.
##### 1.git clone
Open your favorite ternimal and choose a directory you like, such as:
```
>cd fairy/damnHomework
```
Then git clone this project:
```
>git clone https://github.com/2quarius/wordLadder_java.git
```
##### 2.others
Explore yourselves, I am tired.
